# About me
I am a PhD student at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Heidelberg.

My research is focused on few- and many-body physics in ultracold quantum gases and two-dimensional semiconductors.

My research interests include:
* Fermi polarons
* Functional methods
* Strongly correlated Fermi systems
* Superconductivity
* Ultracold quantum gases
* TMDs
