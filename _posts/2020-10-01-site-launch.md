Well, I finally got around to put my own website together. I always wanted a place where I can share my projects and interests,
and if possible, for free. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) turned out to be the perfect tool for this!

The cool thing about it: It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.

Looking forward to talk about Science, Projects, Hobbies and all kind of cool stuff!
